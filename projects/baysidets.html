				<h1>BAYSIDETS</h1>
				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>"baysidets" is the name of this website and also the name of a theoretical company that provides <b>T</b>echnical <b>S</b>olutions. This company may or may not be theoretical forever, but the name remains and has actually stuck for me. This website has turned into more of a personal knowledge base and record-keeping effort for me, but at some point in the future I may transfer this domain over to a more professional public-facing website advertising services, and I'll select a more "personal" domain name for this content.</p>
				<h2>To-do</h2>
				<h3>General</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="todo-completed">
						New logo!
					</li>
					<li>
						Set up other pages
					</li>
					<li>
						Script (JS, Shell, Python, or some other) that will ensure certain elements (e.g. nav, footer, some parts of the head) are the same across all pages
					</li>
					<li>
						Add some more substance to the header:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Blurb about what the website offers; if I take the commercial route, what services I offer with a hook
							</li>
							<li>
								Links to other media (e.g. GitHub, ... probably something else too)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Move some stuff from Google Drive knowledge base to here:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Books and book notes
							</li>
							<li class="todo-completed">
								Research and articles
							</li>
							<li>
								Skills and progress tracking
							</li>
							<li>
								Toolkits (like RE calculators, etc.)
							</li>
							<li>
								Business related stuff
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Word count at the bottom of every page in footer (word count should only count content in #content)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Homepage</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="todo-completed">
						Configure and style headlines
					</li>
					<li>
						Scripts for headlines
					</li>

								Consider using the details and summary tags. This will come in handy in the TKR page. Refer to <a href="https://iamkate.com/code/tree-views/">https://iamkate.com/code/tree-views/</a>
							</li>
							<li class="todo-completed">
								Make indent hanging (not just first line)
							</li>
						</ul>

					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Log</h2>
				<h3>2024-10-31</h3>
				<p>I've been slowly working on this website for a while now, but most of what I've done to it has been some routine HTML/CSS, with the exception of the setup work I did in the beginning (I will at some point make a detailed post somewhere in this website about how I set up the web server, configured DNS records, etc.) Today, however, I finally set up SSL/TLS for baysidets.com with the intention of practicing for when I do it for the <a href="./trolleywebmap.html">trolley webmap</a>, and so I'd like to record how I did it.</p>
				<p>The process I followed was pretty straightforward thanks to the guide provided in <a href="https://scriptstown.com/how-to-setup-cloudflare-ssl-and-configure-origin-certificate-for-apache/">this handy site</a>. I am regurgitating the information here in case that site ever goes kaput. Anyway, here are the steps:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In your web server, create a directory to store the SSL certificate and key: <span class="file-path">sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl</span></li>
					<li>Enable SSL in Apache if it hasn't been already: <span class="file-path">sudo a2enmod ssl</span><p class="sub-paragraph">If you're logged in as root, you may get the error <span class="file-path">a2enmod: command not found</span>. If so, log in as a user with sudoer privileges: <span class="file-path">su user</span></p></li>
					<li>Restart Apache: <span class="file-path">sudo systemctl restart apache2</span></li>
					<li>Now, in your CloudFlare account, navigate to your domain and go to the <i>SSL/TLS</i> tab, then <i>Origin Server</i>. Click the <i>Create Certificate</i> button. The default options should be O.K. Then click <i>Create</i>. This will generate an <i>Origin Certificate</i>, and a <i>Private Key</i>. Do not leave the page yet as we'll need these values and you will not be able to see the Private Key again.</li>
					<li>Copy the Origin Certificate value into a file in the SSL directory as such: <span class="file-path">sudo nano /etc/apache2/ssl/example.com.pem</span></li>
					<li>Copy the Private Key value into a file in the SSL directory as such: <span class="file-path">sudo nano /etc/apache2/ssl/example.com.key</span></li>
					<li>Change the permission of this directory: <span class="file-path">sudo chmod -R 655 /etc/apache2/ssl</span></li>
					<li>Change the ownership to "www-data": <span class="file-path">sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /etc/apache2/ssl</span></li>
					<li>
						Now, let's configure the web server's virtual host file to use SSL: <span class="file-path">sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf</span>
						<p class="sub-paragraph">Change the file path next to <i>SSLCertificateFile</i> to be your origin certificate, and the file path next to <i>SSLCertificateKeyFile</i> to be your private key.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Now, let's activate this virtual host file: <span class="file-path">sudo a2ensite default-ssl.conf</span></li>
					<li>And now, let's reload Apache: <span class="file-path">sudo systemctl restart apache2</span></li>
					<li>One other important piece of the puzzle is going into CloudFlare and changing the SSL/TLS encryption mode to <b>Full (strict)</b>.</li>
					<li>Make sure <b>port 443</b> is enabled in the firewall (e.g. <span class="file-path">sudo ufw allow 443</span>).</li>
				</ol>
				<p>That should be all there is to it!</p>
