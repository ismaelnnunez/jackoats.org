				<h1>WELCOME</h1>
				<p>Welcome to my site! This is my first rodeo at developing a legit, public-facing site, so what it will become is still a mystery and will be part of the fun for me and anyone else who may be watching along. At the very least, I would like to put up blogs, organize a personal wiki of sorts, and document some of my projects. I'm sure I'll come up with a bunch of other ideas along the way, so I'll be sure to document those too.</p>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I am a civil engineer (technically a civil engineer-in-training) working in land development in Northern Virginia. While civil engineering is my job, and I really like civil engineering, I also really like a bunch of other things, and it has proven to be a difficult task to stay on top of all of them to make any sort of progress in them. This project was, in part, born out of an interest in documenting all of these interests in an effort to make my life easier. A very nice bonus is that I'll be able to view all this information from anywhere with internet access. Maybe, I hope, the information I post to this site will prove valuable to someone else out there too.</p>
