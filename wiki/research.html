						<td>Questions to address:<br>
							1. Has housing really become unaffordable?<br>
							2. How does housing affordability compare in rentals vs. owned? What governs pricing in both markets?<br>
							3. If housing really is becoming unaffordable, what can we do about it? What have we tried to do about it already and has it failed/succeeded?<br>
							Topics to discuss:<br>
							- NIMBY vs. YIMBY<br>
							- Arlington's EHO<br>
							- Rent control<br>
							- Northern Virginia as an example of housing affordability</td>
