						<p class="wiki-wiki-wip"><b>Market Allocation Scheme</b> - The following is information provided by ChatGPT and has not been vetted.</p>
						<!-- I was first prompted to look into this when I was in the Senior Project II class and Robin Kemper, former ASCE president, brought up a scenario where two civil engineering firms in New Jersey were tired of competing for clients and decided to divide their territories where one would take clients from one section of the state and the other firm would take the other section. As it turns out, this is unethical and an unfair competition practice. I wasn't sure why, so I asked ChatGPT, and it brought up some good points: -->
						<ol class="wiki-wiki-wip">
							<li>Violation of Antitrust Laws: By dividing their territories, the two civil engineering firms are engaging in market allocation, which violates antitrust laws. This unethical behavior is punishable by law and can lead to fines and legal action.</li>
							<li>Unfair Competition: Dividing territories creates a monopoly for each firm in their respective area, eliminating competition. This means that clients in each area will not have access to the best possible services or prices that would come with competitive bids.</li>
							<li>Lack of Transparency: Clients may not be aware of the territorial division and may assume that they have access to multiple firms, leading to a false sense of competition and choice.</li>
							<li>Limited Professional Development: The engineers working for the two firms may have limited opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge, since they are not exposed to diverse projects or different types of clients.</li>
							<li>Unfairness to Employees: The territorial division may result in a reduced workload and less work for some employees, leading to layoffs or reduced hours, and adversely affecting their livelihoods.</li>
							<li>Violation of Professional Standards: The territorial division may go against the professional standards of the civil engineering profession, which requires competition and fair bidding processes to ensure that the best interests of clients and the public are served.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="wiki-wiki-wip">In summary, the territorial division of clients by the two civil engineering firms presents several ethical dilemmas related to competition, fairness, transparency, professional development, and compliance with professional standards.<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">[1]</a></p>

						<h3>Finance</h3>
						<p><b>Financial Instruments</b> are instruments that have a monetary value, and represent a liability to one party and an asset to another.<a class="ref" href="#ref-2">[2]</a> An <b>instrument</b> is a legal document that records agreements or actions that are legally enforceable.</p>
						<p class="sub-paragraph">Examples of legal instruments include contracts, wills, deeds, and statutes.<a class="ref" href="#ref-3">[3]</a></p>
						<p>Examples of financial instruments include stocks, bonds, options contracts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Another example of a type of financial instrument is a security. <b>Securities</b> are <b>fungible</b>, negotiable financial instruments.</p>
						<p class="sub-paragraph">Fungibility is the ability for something to be interchanged for something else of the same type for the same value. Currency, for example, is fungible because a $1 bill is always going to be worth $1 no matter who owns it or where you use it. Real estate is a non-fungible legal instrument because no one property is identical to another and its value is dependent on several factors like location, history, flood exposure, etc. <a class="ref" href="#ref-4">[4]</a></p>
						<p>Further, securities represent ownership in some sort of asset (in something that is worth some monetary value).</p>
							<h4>Stocks</h4>
							<p class="wiki-wiki-wip">Placeholder.</p>
								<h5>Index Funds vs. Exchange-Traded-Funds vs. Mutual Funds</h5>
								<p>An <b>Index</b> is not traded, it is  just a list of stocks. The S&P 500 is an example of an index, as is the NASDAQ. An <b>index fund</b> is an umbrella term for many exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. If a <b>fund</b> – a pool of money that is invested – tracks an index, it is an index fund.</p>
								<p><b>Mutual funds</b> are created by companies and are typically not traded in a stock exchange. You can trade shares of these funds usually directly with the company, such as Fidelity or Vanguard. FXAIX is an example of a mutual fund. Mutual fund prices are usually posted at the end of the trading day.</p>
								<p><b>ETFs</b> are like mutual funds, except that they are traded in public stock exchanges and are also therefore posted variably throughout the day like any individual stock.</p>
							<h5>Options</h5>
							<p class="wiki-wiki-wip">Placeholder.</p>
							<h5>Bonds</h5>
							<p class="wiki-wiki-wip">Bonds, bond funds vs. individual bonds, risks behind bonds, undersubscribed bonds.</p>
						<h3>Trading Conventions</h3>
							<h4>Order Types</h4>
							<p>An <b>order</b></p> is quite simply that - an order to trade (buy or sell) a certain stock. But there are several types of orders you can make thanks to the power of automation<a class="ref" href="#ref-5">[5]</a>:
							<ul>
								<li><b>Market Order</b> - These are the most straightforward types of orders. Market orders are orders to buy or sell immediately at the current price. A posted <b>ask</b> is the current price to buy, and the posted <b>bid</b> is the current price to sell. Market orders are good if you want to guarantee that you get the current price and do not want to subject your order to volatility.</li>
								<li><b>Limit Order</b> - These orders allow you to place an order if the stock reaches a desired price. Different types of limit orders specify exactly what this threshold is and what criteria are attached to it:</li>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Buy limit orders</b> specify the maximum price at which to buy a stock. If the price of a stock falls below your limit, the order will be executed. This also means any price up to your desired maximum is fair game. The price of a stock might go down rapidly, “never reaching” the desired limit. There also might not be enough buyers at a certain price, further driving the cost down below the desired limit.</li>
									<li><b>Sell limit orders</b> function the same way but the other way around: a sell limit order specifies the minimum price at which to execute a sell.</li>
									<li class="wiki-wiki-wip"><b>Buy stop orders</b> - Placeholder.</li>
									<li class="wiki-wiki-wip"><b>Sell stop roders</b> - Placeholder.</li>
								</ul>
